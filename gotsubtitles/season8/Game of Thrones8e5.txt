We have won the Great War.
Now we will win the last war.
The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying
King's Landing.
You heading to King's Landing?
There's some unfinished business.
Me too.
I don't plan on coming back.
Neither do I.
I always wanted to be there when they execute your sister.
Seems like
I won't get the chance.
Stay with me.
Please.
Cersei's hateful...
And so am I.
I need to tell you something.
But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.
What if there's someone else?
Someone better.
At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person.
Even if you know it's a mistake?
He has the better claim to the throne.
Every time a Targaryen is born, the gods flip a coin.
The Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved.
Children are not their fathers.
- Be a dragon.
- You have a gentle heart.
A Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing.
You don't want to awake the dragon, do you?
Come in.
And?
Nothing?
She won't eat.
We'll try again at supper.
I think they're watching me.
- Who?
- Her soldiers.
Of course they are.
That's their job.
What have I told you, Martha?
The greater the risk, the greater the reward.
Go on. They'll be missing you in the kitchen.
The Northern armies?
Just crossed the Trident.
They'll be at the walls of King's Landing in two days.
How is she?
She hasn't seen anyone since we returned.
Hasn't left her chambers, hasn't accepted any food.
She shouldn't be alone.
You're worried for her.
I admire your empathy.
Aren't you worried for her?
I'm worried for all of us.
They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath.
We're not much for riddles where I'm from.
We both know what she's about to do.
That's her decision to make.
She is our queen.
Men decide where power resides, whether or not they know it.
What do you want?
All I've ever wanted.
The right ruler on the Iron Throne.
I still don't know how her coin has landed.
But I'm quite certain about yours.
I don't want it.
I never have.
I have known more kings and queens than any man living.
I've heard what they say to crowds, and seen what they do in the shadows.
I have furthered their designs, however horrible.
But what I tell you now is true:
You will rule wisely and well, while she...
She... is my queen.
Your Grace?
There's something you need to know.
Someone has betrayed me.
Yes.
Jon Snow.
Varys.
He knows the truth about Jon.
He does.
Because you told him.
You learned from Sansa.
And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her.
As I said... he betrayed me.
I'm glad Sansa told me.
I am your Hand.
I need to be aware of any threats you're facing.
And Varys?
Your Master of Whisperers needs to be aware too.
You spoke to him first.
Without coming to me.
Without asking my permission.
It was a mistake.
Why do you think
Sansa told you?
What do you think she hoped to gain?
- She trusts me.
- Yes, she trusts you.
She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen.
And you did not let her down.
If I have failed you, my queen, forgive me.
Our intentions were good.
We wanted what you want.
A better world, all of us.
Varys as much as anyone.
But it doesn't matter now.
No.
It doesn't matter now.
It was me.
I hope I deserve this.
Truly, I do.
I hope I'm wrong.
Goodbye, old friend.
Lord Varys.
I, Daenerys of House Targaryen,
First of My Name,
Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons... sentence you to die.
Dracarys.
This was all she brought with her when we crossed the Narrow Sea.
Her only possession.
What did I say would happen if you told your sister?
I don't want it, and that's what I told him.
She betrayed your trust.
She killed Varys as much as I did.
This was a victory for her.
Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you.
Far more people in Westeros love you than love me.
I don't have love here.
I only have fear.
I love you.
And you will always be my queen.
Is that all I am to you?
Your queen?
All right, then.
Let it be fear.
The people who live there, they're not your enemies.
They're innocents, like the ones you liberated in Meereen.
In Meereen, the slaves turned on the masters and liberated the city themselves the moment I arrived.
They're afraid.
Anyone who resists Cersei will see his family butchered.
You can't expect them to be heroes.
- They're hostages.
- They are.
In a tyrant's grip.
Whose fault is that? Mine?
What does it matter whose fault it is?
Thousands of children will die if the city burns.
Your sister knows how to use her enemies' weaknesses against them.
That's what she thinks our mercy is: weakness.
- I beg you, my queen...
- But she's wrong.
Mercy is our strength.
Our mercy towards future generations who will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.
Ready the Unsullied.
Tonight you sail for King's Landing
- to join the Northern armies.
- Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost.
Give them that chance.
If the city surrenders, they will ring the bells and raise the gates.
Please, if you hear them ringing the bells, call off the attack.
Wait for me outside the city.
You'll know when it's time.
Your brother was stopped trying to get past our lines.
It seems he hasn't abandoned your sister after all.
The next time you fail me... will be the last time you fail me.
Let them pass.
Through the gate.
Get going.
The rearguard should be here by daybreak.
She wants to attack now.
Daybreak at the earliest.
- Careful with that.
- My lord.
Davos.
I need to ask you a favor.
You're the greatest smuggler alive, aren't you?
I'm not gonna like this favor, am I?
He's always better when he's got some food in him.
Problem is when he's got drink in him.
See what he did the other week?
Aye. Fighting as well.
Commander nearly caught him.
Ay up. Where you going?
I'm Arya Stark.
I'm going to kill Queen Cersei.
Think about it.
She kills Cersei, the war's over.
There won't be a siege.
You might not even die tomorrow.
I need to go talk to my captain.
Go ahead, talk to him.
Where's he going?
We speak the common tongue.
Ah. Good.
I want to be alone with the prisoner.
Get some rest.
Tomorrow will be a long day.
We have orders to guard the prisoner.
Ordered by whom?
The queen herself?
- No.
- Well, in that case, as Hand of the Queen, I outrank whomever gave your order.
Probably by quite a lot.
How did they find you?
Did you consider taking it off?
Cersei once called me
"the stupidest Lannister."
And you're going back to her, to die with her.
You've underestimated her before.
She's going to die.
Unless you can convince her to change her course of action.
Difficult to do from here.
When have I ever been able to convince Cersei of anything?
Try.
If not for yourself, if not for her, then for every one of the million people in that city, innocent or otherwise.
To be honest, I never really cared much for them.
Innocent or otherwise.
You do care for one innocent.
I know you do.
And so does Cersei.
She has a reason now.
The child is the reason she'll never give an inch.
All the worst things she's ever done, she's done for her children.
It's not impossible that she'll win.
She won't.
Her enemy's forces have been depleted, as she said they would be.
Two of the three dragons are dead.
- She's evened the odds.
- The city will fall tomorrow.
She has the Lannister army, she has the Golden Company...
I defended the city last time it was attacked.
I know it better than anyone.
It will fall tomorrow.
Then I suppose I'll die tomorrow, if not before.
Why?
Escape.
The two of you, together.
Remember where we met, where they keep the dragon skulls, beneath the Red Keep?
Take her down there.
Keep following the stairways down, down as far as they'll go.
You'll come out onto a beach at the foot of the keep.
A dinghy will be waiting for you.
Sail out of the bay.
If the winds are kind, you'll make it to Pentos.
Start a new life.
Sail right past the Iron Fleet and into a new life?
Sounds a lot less likely than Cersei winning this war...
There won't be an Iron Fleet for much longer.
Do it.
If you don't, you'll never see Cersei again.
Swear to me.
You have my word.
If it works, give the order to ring all the bells in King's Landing and open the gates.
That will be our signal that the city has surrendered.
I'll try.
I never thought
I'd get to repay the favor.
Remember, ring the bells and open the gates.
Your queen will execute you for this.
If Daenerys can make it to the throne without wading through a river of blood, maybe she'll show mercy to the person who made that possible.
Tens of thousands of innocent lives... one not particularly innocent dwarf... it seems like a fair trade.
If it weren't for you,
I never would've survived my childhood.
You would have.
You were the only one who didn't treat me like a monster.
You were all I had.
Eyes on the horizon!
Load the scorpion!
Archers, close up!
Come on!
Up to the espringal!
To the back of it!
Archers, line up!
This way! Come on!
Clear the streets now!
- No!
- In, now.
- And you, come on.
- Inside, now!
Quickly.
Yes. Follow down there.
They're here.
Get to the Red Keep.
- My son!
- Get inside!
Just ahead of you,
I can see it!
All right, move it!
- Come on!
- Keep moving!
- Keep going!
- Keep moving!
- Quickly!
- All the way!
- Come on!
- Come on!
Hold your mother's hand!
Make way for the Golden Company!
Close the gate!
If you hear the bells ring, they've surrendered.
Call off your men.
Move along now, lads.
- That's it.
- Go on, move it.
Come on, move, move.
Faster, faster. Come on, move it.
- Keep going.
- Keep moving.
- Move.
- Stay with him.
- Hold on.
- Hold my hand.
Get behind there.
Close the gate!
No more through.
- No.
- No. Mommy.
- Vicky! Please!
- No, please, sir!
- Open the gate!
- Close the gate!
- Open it!
- Open the gate!
- Get back.
- Look, try that one. Go. Go.
The gates are locked now!
Open!
- Get back!
- Open the gate!
Soldier! Soldier!
- Please open the gate!
- Go back to your homes!
Stay back! It's closed!
Soldier!
Move away! Stop!
Let us in!
We're not leaving!
Turn!
- Turn it around!
- Turn it around!
Get back! Back!
Fire!
I can see her!
Ready!
Move!
Fire!
- Reload!
- Reload!
Faster!
Hurry!
Fire!
Go!
Run!
Your Grace.
All we need is one good shot.
The scorpions have all been destroyed, Your Grace.
The Iron Fleet hold Blackwater Bay.
Euron killed one of her dragons.
He can kill another.
Your Grace, the Iron Fleet is burning.
The gates have been breached.
The Golden Company...
Our men will fight harder than sellswords ever could.
They will defend their queen to the last man.
- Yes, Your Grace.
- The Red Keep has never fallen.
It won't fall today.
No, no, no!
Move, move!
Run.
Run!
Come on!
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!
The bells!
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!
Ring the bloody bells!
- Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!
Tell the queen to ring the bells.
Ring the bells!
Ring the bell!
This way.
Ring the bell!
Ring the bell!
Ring them!
Ring the bells!
Ring the bells!
- Ring the bells!
- Help us!
In the name of the...
Queen! We're surrounded!
- Ring the bells!
- Now! Come on!
Hurry up!
Ring the bells!
No!
Get back!
Get back!
Stay! Stay!
No, no, no, no, no.
Quickly. Quickly.
Stop!
- Get off me! Get off, bitch!
- No, get off! Help! Help!
No!
Go!
Go!
Find somewhere to hide.
My God!
The Kingslayer.
We need to get the queen out of King's Landing.
Listen.
That's the sound of a city dying.
It's over.
Well, maybe for you.
If you kill another king before you die... they'll sing about you forever.
You're no king.
Oh, but I am.
And I fucked the queen.
If I win...
I'll bring your head to Cersei so you can kiss her one last time.
Your Grace, it isn't safe here any longer.
The Red Keep is the safest place in the city.
The Unsullied have breached the gates of the Red Keep.
Maegor's Holdfast would be a better place to wait out the storm.
You fought well... for a cripple.
Another king for you.
But I got you!
I got you!
I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister.
Go home, girl.
The fire will get her, or one of the Dothraki.
Or maybe that dragon will eat her.
It doesn't matter. She's dead.
And you'll be dead too if you don't get out of here.
I'm going to kill her.
You think you wanted revenge a long time?
I've been after it all my life.
It's all I care about.
And look at me. Look at me!
You wanna be like me?
You come with me, you die here.
Sandor.
Thank you.
Your Grace.
Hello, big brother.
Ser Gregor, stay by my side.
Ser Gregor, I command you.
Obey your queen, Ser Gregor.
Yeah, that's you.
That's what you've always been.
You're hurt.
It doesn't matter.
You're bleeding.
Alanna!
Alanna! Have you seen my wife?
Have you seen my wife?
- Let go.
- Have you seen my wife?
Out of the way!
No!
Oh.
Take my hand.
Take my hand.
Get up. Get up.
- No. No.
- Wait! Wait!
No!
Fucking die!
We need to fall back!
Fall back behind the wall!
- Fall back!
- Fall back!
Get out of the city!
Fall back!
Fall back!
- Fall back!
- Fall back!
You can't stay here.
You have to keep moving.
We can't go out there.
You have to.
Everyone out there is dead.
If you stay here, you'll die.
Follow me.
Follow me!
Come on, quickly. Come to me.
Lean him up there.
Come on, quickly. All of you!
Run!
Run!
Mama!
Mama!
Mama! No.
Mama! Mama!
Mama!
Get up.
Get up!
We have to keep moving.
Take her.
Take her!
- Take her.
- Come on!
Come on!
This way.
I want our baby to live.
I want our baby to live.
I want our baby to live.
Don't let me die, Jaime.
Please don't let me die.
It's all right.
- Please don't let me die.
- It's all right.
I don't want to die.
Just look... Look at me.
- Look at me.
- Not like this.
Not like this. Not like this.
Look... Look...
Look me in the eye.
Don't look away. Don't look...
Look at me! Just look at me.
Nothing else matters.
Nothing else matters.
Only us.
There's something you need to know.
Someone has betrayed me.
Varys.
He knows the truth about Jon?
He does.
Dany is an incredibly strong person.
She's also someone who has had really close friendships and close advisors for her entire run of the show.
You look at those people who have been closest to her for such a long time, and almost all of them have either turned on her or died, and she's very much alone.
And that's a dangerous thing for someone who's got so much power, to feel that isolated.
So at the very time when she needs guidance and those kind of close friendships and advice the most, everyone's gone.
I think that Varys knew that it was unlikely that he would survive the attempt to overthrow Dany in favor of Jon.
And he also knew that he ethically, in his mind, had no choice but to... try to do that anyway.
It was me.
Goodbye, old friend.
I think that Tyrion is saying goodbye to his best friend in the world outside of his brother.
Dracarys.
And the amount of guilt that he feels over being the cause for his best friend's imminent death, it's hard to really get your head around.
I don't have love here.
I only have fear.
You will always be my queen.
Jon Snow is someone that she's fallen in love with.
And as far as she's concerned, by this point,
Jon has betrayed her by telling people about his true identity, and also the fact he's unable to return her affections at this point.
All right then.
Let it be fear.
I think that when she says,
"Let it be fear," she's resigning herself to the fact that she may have to get things done in a way that isn't pleasant.
And she may have to get things done in a way that is horrible for lots of people.
Mercy is our strength.
Our mercy towards future generations, he will never again be held hostage by a tyrant.
She chose violence.
A Targaryen choosing violence is a pretty terrifying thing.
Even when you look back to season one, when Khal Drogo gives the golden crown to Viserys, and her reaction of watching her brother's head melted off...
He was no dragon.
...and he was a terrible brother, you know, so I don't think anyone out there was... was crying when Viserys died, but... there is something kind of chilling about the way that Dany has responded to the death of her enemies.
And if circumstances had been different,
I don't think this side of Dany ever would've come out.
If Cersei hadn't betrayed her, if Cersei hadn't executed
Missandei, if Jon hadn't told her the truth.
Like, if all of these things had happened in any different way, then I don't think we'd be seeing this side of
Daenerys Targaryen.
I don't think she decided ahead of time that she was... going to do what she did.
And then she sees the Red Keep, which is, to her, the home that her family built when they first came over to this country 300 years ago.
It's in that moment, on the walls of King's Landing, where she's looking at that symbol of everything that was taken from her, when she makes the decision to... to make this personal.
We wanted her to be just death from above, as seen from the perspective of the people who are on the business end of that dragon.
In most large stories like this, it seems like there's a tendency to focus on the heroic figures and not pay much attention to the people who may be suffering the repercussions of the decisions made by those heroic people, and we... we really wanted to keep our perspective and our... our sympathies on the ground at this moment
'cause those are the people who are really paying the price for the decisions that she's making.
I think that Jon is also in a kind of denial.
At first, the siege is a war, soldiers killing soldiers.
That's what war is.
I think Jon is someone who's always been a very good soldier, who has never enjoyed being a soldier.
He's been trained as a fighter from the time he was a little boy, and he's quite good at it, he's quite good at leading men into battle, and he also hates it.
I think, for him, it all starts out seeming like it's gonna work out, and then it turns into a nightmare.
When she takes off and starts burning the city, the Unsullied on the ground and the Northmen on the ground, take that as their cue that it's a moral free-for-all.
The good guys are behaving like the bad guys, and the bad guys in this shot are the ones who are doing all of these horrific things around him, who are his own men.
The moral lines that he's drawn, for himself, in his own life, can't be maintained for everyone in all situations.
Go home, girl.
It's a small scene, but it's also, for us, one of the most important scenes in the whole episode because it's the culmination of their story together.
And you'll be dead too if you don't get out of here.
I'm going to kill her.
The road to vengeance always ends in one place.
Which is what the Hound is saying to her here.
"I've made my choice a long time ago, and this can only end in one possible way for me.
But for you, you have so many other options."
Look at me!
You want to be like me?
The Hound has genuinely come to have affection for Arya.
I think he loves her as much as he's capable of loving someone.
And he knows that if she comes with him at this point, she's not gonna make it out of there.
Sandor...
Thank you.
Hello, big brother.
We've always wanted to see these two face off again, and they finally did.
It struck us that it would be kind of apocalyptically beautiful to see them fighting on this stairway to nowhere, with the sky in the background and the dragon flying by and the flames everywhere.
We knew that these two were going to die together, at each other's hands, and we knew the Hound's death had to be a death by fire.
So the one thing stronger in the Hound than his fear of fire is his hatred of the person who put that fear there in the first place.
Feels like you needed a perspective to carry you through this horror.
Like you need a Virgil to take you through the hell that Dany's building.
The reason we decided to follow Arya out of King's Landing and to see the fall of King's Landing through her eyes is... something that we talked about with an earlier episode.
You just care a lot more when you're with a character that you care about.
So if we saw a lot of extras running around on fire and buildings falling apart, it might've been visually interesting, but it wouldn't have had much of an emotional impact.
But when you're there on the ground with Arya, who's one of the people we care the most about, then everything takes on that much more of an edge.
We knew that the Hound would be convincing her to part ways with him and to not go to her death.
And once she decides she needs to get out of the city, well, she's in... she's in the worst possible place you can be.
So she's gotta get from that central point all the way outside the walls of the city.
It's the longest, hardest journey anybody has to make in the entire episode.
You know, there's a scene, several years ago, where...
Jaime and Bronn are talking about how they wanna go, and Jaime's talking about dying in the arms of the woman he loves.
And this is it.
I think he knows that they belong together, that they came into this world together, that they need to go out of this world together.
Once he goes through the various exits, and they're all clogged up with rubble, and there's no way out, and he knows there's no way out, he's just trying to calm down the woman he loves because he knows this is it.
Look at me!
Just look at me.
Nothing else matters.
Nothing else matters.
Only us.
I think Jaime, by the end of episode five, has come to terms with who he really is.
And he may not be happy with who he really is, but he knows he's not, he knows what matters to him, and Cersei's what matters to him.
